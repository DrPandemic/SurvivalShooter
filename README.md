SurvivalShooter
===============

A game created (but unfinished) by /Parasithe and /JesseEmond. It was our first big project in AS3. Our first plan was to complete the game, find an artist and find a sponsor on fgl. The game was never finished and probably will never be completed. Initially, it was a closed repo on mercurial, but we decided we had no reasons to keep it closed. So there it is.


The game
========
It is a top down survival shooter. We tried to add another aspect to the style and added resource mangement. With those resource it is possible to create weapons and fortifications to help you survive.


Technologie
===========
The game is created simply with AS3 and without external frameworks. We used tiled to help us create the maps.
